; ************************************************************

; These registry entries register the USB wrapper driver's 
; stream interface. The value of "Prefix" should match what
; is expected by the user-space ceusbkwrapper.dll, as defined
; in the ceusbkwrapperi.h file.
;
; The driver uses DEVFLAGS_NAKEDENTRIES so it is not necessary
; to edit the driver code to change the "Prefix" used if
; the one specified here conflicts with another driver on the
; system.
;
; Interface filters may be defined to prevent the driver from
; accepting control of particular USB interfaces. For an interface
; matching a filter, this driver attempts to find and load an 
; alternative interface driver. If successful, this driver 
; relinquishes control of the interface. Otherwise, this driver 
; attempts to load an alternative driver for the entire device. If 
; successful, this driver relinquishes control of *all* interfaces. 
; However, this driver still reserves the right to send arbitrary 
; control requests to the device on the default control pipe.
;
; Once a filter is matched against an interface, no subsequent filters
; shall be sought for that interface. If an interface would match
; multiple filters, only the first matching filter to be evaluated is 
; actioned. The order in which filters are evaluated can be controlled
; by assigning priorities to the filters. This should be considered if
; there are multiple matching filters which specify different flags.
;
; Each interface filter is defined as a string whose name is prefixed 
; with "InterfaceFilter_". The string specifies a filter in the
; following format:
;
; "[priority;]bInterfaceClass:bInterfaceSubClass:bInterfaceProtocol[:idVendor[:idProduct]][;NO_ATTACH]"
;
; A filter may optionally be prefixed with a priority value, which controls
; the order in which it is evaluated. Interface filters which specify a
; priority are always evaluated in priority order, and before filters which 
; do not specify a priority. The priority element must be an unsigned base 10 
; value, where the value 0 denotes highest priority. Interface filters with
; equal priority shall be evaluated in an arbitrary order.
;
; Each element of the filter may be a base 10 value matching the
; corresponding attribute of the USB interface or '*' (always matching
; the attribute). For example, the interface filter "8:*:*" matches 
; USB interfaces with a bInterfaceClass of 8 (mass storage), regardless 
; of the values of bInterfaceSubClass and bInterfaceProtocol.
;
; Optionally, the idVendor and idProduct fields from the device descriptor
; may also be included in an interface filter. For example, the interface
; filter "8:*:*:1057" matches mass storage interfaces on Nokia devices only
; (idVendor=1057=0x0421).
;
; Any field in the interface filter can be inverted (i.e. changed from MATCH to
; DOES NOT MATCH) by prepending the '!' character. For example, the interface
; filter "8:*:*:!1057" matches mass storage interfaces on all devices except
; Nokia devices.
;
; Some device drivers may not function correctly if this driver has also 
; accepted control of the device. To ensure seamless operation with these
; drivers, an interface filter may have the flag NO_ATTACH appended to it.
; If any matching interface filter has this flag, then this driver shall
; refuse to accept control of the device. No attempt will be made to locate
; drivers for any other matching interface filters for the device. For example,
; the interface filter "2:13:*;NO_ATTACH" will cause this driver to refuse
; to accept control of any device exposing a CDC-NCM interface.
