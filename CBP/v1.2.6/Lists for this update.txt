1. The source was integration with the WinCE source. 
2. Need to add property "ENUM_IBSU_PROPERTY_ROLL_TRIGGER_THRESHOLD"
   - What happened? Customer is requesting a roll property to change threshold on image size for beginning rolls
   - Why did it happen? IBScanUltimate makes rolled prints for small children difficult
   
3. IBScanSDK for CMT has a feature to write custom data into IB USB device (EEPROM) using IBSCAN_PROPERTY_CMT.
However, the property of IBScanUltimate does not have same feature yet.
So if you want it, then I need to add some codes to the property of IBScanUltimate (ex, ENUM_IBSU_PROPERTY_RESERVED_1).
? Need to revise SDK

4. Idversol want the last release which works with their Columbo firmware.

5. Added enumeration value to IBSU_ClientWindowPropertyId (ENUM_IBSU_WINDOW_PROPERTY_SCALE_FACTOR_EX)

7. Bug fixed, WSQ image was flipped
